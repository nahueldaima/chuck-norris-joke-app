# Assignment

Create a Chuck Norris Joke Application

## Getting Started

We as developers like Chuck Norris jokes. Therefor we created the following assignment to test your
Frontend skills/ knowledge.
Please create a git repo (can be local) before you start this assignment. When committing please give a
proper description to explain your choices.
It should only run in chrome (so you can use es6). Please don't use any boilerplates. You can/may use any
framework/lib you want.
When finished send a link or send your folder(zip)

### First Assignment

We want to have an Application where we can fetch 10 Random Chuck Norris jokes. These jokes can be
fetch from the following [API](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/10).
When these jokes are fetched via a button they need to be displayed in a list. In this list we can mark
certain jokes as favourite. The favourite jokes will appear in a favourites list with a max of 10 (unique) items.
There should be an option to remove jokes from the favourite list as well.
On refresh the favourites lists should be maintained.
We can also turn on/off a timer via a button (every 5 seconds) who will add one random joke to the
[favourites list](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/1) until the list has 10 items.

### Second Assignment

Create a login popup that will log you in for the current session. And only appear when the user hasn't
logged in yet for the current session.
The login form should consist of a username and password which must comply to the following password
security requirements:

- Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc , cde , fgh ,
  and so on, up to xyz . They cannot skip letters; acd doesn't count.
- Passwords may not contain the letters i, O, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters
  and are therefore confusing.
- Passwords must contain at least two non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or cc.
- Passwords cannot be longer than 32 characters.
- Passwords can only contain lower case alphabetic characters.
